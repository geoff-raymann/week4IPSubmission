### Setting Up instructions.
* We determined the prices for each size of pizza.
* We estimated the price of a topping and arranged them form the most expensive to the least expensive.
* We then dertemined the price of crust types and arranged them from the least expensive to the most expensive.
* We then determined a way to get the totals considering the above properties.
### Possible BDD we considered.
* The User can choose any size of pizza.
* One type of pizza can only have one and one topping.
* A user can order as many pizzas as they can.
* Pizza can be delivered on selection or not delivered.
* On deliver, a user can either enter a collection point within CBD or outside CBD
* Within CBD are usually freely delivered while outside CBD we charge utmost 300
### The pricing was done with estimate values and this was majorly for practice purposes.
